# STM32_VN9D30Q100F_Library
Library used for easy setup and control of VN9D30Q100F via SPI on STM32 devices

## How to use
Copy contents of "inc" and "src" folders into the "Inc" and "Src" folders of your STM32 project. The fuse.hpp file should have most of it's usage explained in comments. Summarizing the library defines VN9D30Q100F cotroller class and handler class.

## Draw backs
For now the library uses the open sorce ETL library
